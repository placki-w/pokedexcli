This is a guided project from Boot.dev to create a pokedex cli tool with data from the pokemon api: https://pokeapi.co/

Use commands like map to get location areas. Or mapb to go backwards.

Use command explore to check out pokemon in that area.

Use command catch to catch a pokemon.

Use command inspect to see stats on said pokemon.

Use pokedex to list captured pokemon.

Use exit to exit.

Help exists as well...

Works, but I didn't really test it outside of my local repository.
